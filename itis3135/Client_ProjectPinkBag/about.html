        <h2>About US</h2>
        <p>Project PinkBag is a non-profit organization dedicated to menstrual hygiene and women's empowerment in Bangladesh. Our team consists of passionate individuals who are committed to making a positive impact. We work tirelessly to break down the barriers that girls and women face due to limited access to menstrual supplies and the stigma surrounding menstruation. Through our distribution of sanitary products and educational programs, we strive to improve the overall well-being and self-esteem of the girls and women we serve.
