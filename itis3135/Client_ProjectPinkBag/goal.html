        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>Our primary goal at Project PinkBag is to ensure that every girl and woman in Bangladesh has access to safe and hygienic menstrual supplies, empowering them to manage their periods with dignity. We believe that menstrual hygiene is a cornerstone of gender equality and women's empowerment. By providing these essential resources and education, we aspire to break the taboos and stigmas associated with menstruation, ultimately fostering an environment where every girl and woman can thrive and achieve their full potential.
