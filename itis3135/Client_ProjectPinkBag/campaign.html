      <h2>Successful Campaign</h2>
      <p>
        Our first successful PinkBag campaign held in June 2022.
        During this campaign, we provided 60 girls with a full a year of sanitary
        at KUIH High School in Gopalgonj. We also gave some educational materials to the other
        boys and girls so they don't feel left out. In the future, 
        we aim to conduct workshops and awareness programs to promote menstrual health education and
        empower women with the knowledge they need. The campaign not only provided essential 
        supplies but also initiated important conversations and broke down barriers, furthering 
        our mission to create lasting change.
