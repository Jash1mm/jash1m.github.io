        <h2>Why it Matters to Us?</h2>
        <p>At Project PinkBag, our commitment to improving the lives of girls and women in Bangladesh is rooted in a deep sense of responsibility and compassion. We believe that menstrual hygiene is not just a matter of personal health but also a fundamental right that can significantly impact the well-being, confidence, and future opportunities of individuals. By addressing this critical issue, we aim to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those in underserved communities in Bangladesh.
