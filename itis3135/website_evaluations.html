        <ul>
            <li><strong>C</strong> - The background and foreground is extremly busy and use of multiple different colors creates an unpleasant contrast.</li>
            <br><li><strong>R</strong> - Their repetions are scattered all around the place and makes it difficult to read.</li>
            <br><li><strong>A</strong> - Alignments are sometime centered and sometime left sided which makes it difficult for the audience to read.</li>
            <br><li><strong>P</strong> - Proximity in this website is extremly tight to each other and gives a headache.</li>
