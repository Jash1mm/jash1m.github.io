        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am originally from Bangladesh, born, and raised in the capital Dhaka. 
                Fast forward, I went to Wilkes Community College to get my associate degree and transferred to UNCC to get a 
                BS in Computer Science degree.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I am not in the workforce yet, 
                but I have applied to multiple companies to get an internship in summer 2024.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>I am a student at UNC Charlotte pursuing a BS in Computer Science 
                Degree with a concentration in Cybersecurity.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>Technology has advanced and so have cybercrimes, 
                I want to help the companies that need security in their companies the most. Besides, I do like 
                the idea of being challenged every day in the workforce so I don’t get bored by doing the same work.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>My Primary platform is a MacBook, but I also use a Windows Desktop.  
            </li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking and Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3200 - Introduction to Information Security & Privacy:</strong> Security concepts and mechanisms,
                         security technologies, and intrusion detection and preventions are the key objectives to take this course.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 2181 – Introduction to Computer Systems:</strong> I want to gain knowledge of computer architectures,
                         operating systems, programming languages, and networks which I believe will be helpful for my career in Cybersecurity.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3155 – Software Engineering: </strong>Taking this course is helping me to understand engineering principles, 
                        methods, and techniques to create software. It might become important if I go into that area where I will need to write code 
                        and interact with software.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong>I am creating videos on YouTube with two friends. The Contents of the videos 
                are about how the same things are different in three different continents (United States, China, and Bangladesh).</li>
            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong>I love to play cricket, soccer, chess, and table tennis.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Graduation: </strong>December, 2024</li>
